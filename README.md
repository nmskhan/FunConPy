# FunCPy
Resting state fMRI functional connectivity preprocessing in Python using [FSL](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki), [AFNI](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/) and [ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs).

This pipeline is a collection of steps that can be used to process a single subject's resting state data from raw into a node based correlation matrix representing connectivity between different regions of the brain.

# Pipeline Details

**Step 0**
Reorient into LAS, convert into nii.gz.

**Step 1**
Throwaway inital volumes. FSL's slice timing correction.

- If –throwaway is defined, this number of timepoints will be disregarded during this step.
- If starting with a BXH header, you'll likely have the sliceorder field which will be used to create a custom sliceorder file to be used by FSL.
- If this isn't present, then you'll need to define –sliceorder so that we can generate the file for you:
  - “odd” is interleaved with odd, then even slice ordering: 1,3,5,2,4,6,etc
  - “even” is also interleaved, but when even slice ordering: 2,4,6,1,3,5,etc 
  - “up” is ascending data, from the bottom up: 1,2,3,4,5,6
  - “down” is descending data, from the top down: 6,5,4,3,2,1

**Step 2**
Motion correction using FSL's MCFLIRT. Linear regression of motion parameters.

- MCFLIRT will register each volume to the middle volume. For more detail see [MCFLIRT's documentation](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MCFLIRT)
- Once MCFLIRT is completed, the 6 motion parameters are regressed out of each individual voxel using a linear regression.

**Step 3**
Skull stripping using FSL's [BET](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/BET/UserGuide) or AFNI's [3dAutoMask](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dAutomask.html) + [3dSkullStrip](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dSkullStrip.html)
- BET (default): 
  - The functional run is meaned across time with fslmaths, then brain extraction (BET) is applied. The resulting mask is then applied to the entire run of data. 
  - The fractional intensity threshold can be set with ```--fval``` for the fucntional BET and ```--anatfval``` for the T1 BET. Range is 0-1, and smaller values give larger brain outline estimates.
- AFNI:
  - To use AFNI for skull stripping, pass the flag ```--afnistrip```.
  - The functional run is skull stripped with 3dAutoMask. The clip level fraction can be set with ```--fval```. Range is 0.1-0.9, and smaller values give larger brain outline estimates.
  - The T1 image is is skull stripped with 3dSkullStrip. The shrink factor, which controls teh intensity threshold can be set with ```--anatfval```. Range is 0-1, and smaller values give larger brain outline estimates.

**Step 4**
Normalization the data using FSL's [FLIRT](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FLIRT) + [FNIRT](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FNIRT) or [ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs). 

- If no options are specified, then the default template is the standard MNI152_T1_2mm_brain. If you have a specific template, you can define it with ```–ref```. If using your own template, you must also specify white matter, gray matter, CSF and brain masks for that template. These can be obtained using FSL's [FAST](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FAST) segmentation
- FSL (default):
  - If you've provided at T1 anatomical image then this sequence is followed:
    - Func to T1 coregistration (Affine registration using FLIRT with 12 dof)
    - T1 to Template (Nonlinear normalization with FNIRT)
  - If a T1 anatomical image is not provided then only one one step is taken:
    - Func to MNI (Affine normalization using FLIRT with 12 dof)
- ANTs:
  - To use ANTs for normalization pass the flag ```--ants```.
  - If you've provided at T1 anatomical image then this sequence is followed:
    - Func to T1 coregistration (Affine registration with "BOLDAffine" ANTs tranform)
    - T1 to Template (Nonlinear normalization with SyN)
  - If a T1 anatomical image is not provided then one one step is taken:
    - Func to MNI (Affine + nonlinear normalization with "SyNBOLDAffine" ANTs tranform)
 - For a comparision between methods please see Klein A. et. al (2009) (doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.12.037)
**Step 5**
Regress out CSF and WM signal using template masks generated by FAST.

**Step 6**
Signal detrending using AFNI's [3dDetrend](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dDetrend.html)

- Removes trendspo from voxel time series using linear least squares. Each voxel is treated independently.
  - Detrending can be constant (0), constant+linear(1), constant+linear+quadratic(2), or contant+linear+quadratic+cubic(3). Default is 2.

**Step 7**
Band-pass filtering using AFNI's [3dBandpass](https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/doc/program_help/3dBandpass.html).

- Remove high or low frequency noise.  
  - The default lowpass is 0.08 Hz.
  - The default highpass is at 0.01 Hz.
  - For details on why AFNI's badnpass filtering is used, please check [this discussion](https://neurostars.org/t/bandpass-filtering-different-outputs-from-fsl-and-nipype-custom-function/824).

**Step 8**
Smoothing with a FWHM gaussian kernel.

The default width is 5 mm.

**Step 9**
Parcelation and time series correlation.

- If defaults are used, then the aal_MNI_V4 label file is used to extract the average timeseries for each of the 116 regions of th8e [Automated Anatomical Labelling Atlas](http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/tools/aal-aal2/). If you want to provide your own label file, the –corrlabel option can be used. The input to this step would be a 3D image of ROIs the same size as your normalized data. Each individual ROI needs to have a unique intensity value for the timecourse extraction.

- This step produces 4 files:
  - “subject.graphml” : graphml format with regions timecourse, zr_vals, r_vals.
  - “corrlabel_ts.txt”: extracted time series for each region.
  - “r_matrix.nii.gz”: the correlation coefficients.
  - “zr_matrix.nii.gz”: normalized correlation coefficients.
  - “mask_matrix.nii.gz”: an inclusion mask for everything below the intersect of the regions.

**Step 10**
Functional connectivity density mapping.

Takes functional data from last step and calculates how connected they are to the voxels around them. Adapted from Dardo Tomasi, PNAS(2010), vol. 107, no. 21. 9885–9890.

                        to the correlation.
  --dvarsthreshold=THRESH
                        If specified, this reprsents a DVARS threshold either
                        in BOLD units, or if ending in a '%' character, as a
                        percentage of mean global signal intensity (over the
                        brain mask).  Any volume contributing to a DVARS value
                        greater than this threshold will be excluded
                        ("scrubbed") from the (final) correlation step.  DVARS
                        calculation is performed on the results of the last
                        pre-processing step, and is calculated as described by
                        Power, J.D., et al., "Spurious but systematic
                        correlations in functional connectivity MRI networks
                        arise from subject motion", NeuroImage(2011).  Note:
                        data is only excluded during the final correlation,
                        and so will never affect any operations that require
                        the full signal, like regression, etc.
  --dvarsnumneighbors=NUMNEIGHBORS
                        If --dvarsthreshold is specified, then
                        --dvarsnumnumneighbors specifies how many neighboring
                        volumes, before and after the initially excluded
                        volumes, should also be excluded.  Default is 0.
  --fdthreshold=THRESH  If specified, this reprsents a FD threshold in mm.
                        Any volume contributing to a FD value greater than
                        this threshold will be excluded ("scrubbed") from the
                        (final) correlation step.  FD calculation is performed
                        on the results of the last pre-processing step, and is
                        calculated as described by Power, J.D., et al.,
                        "Spurious but systematic correlations in functional
                        connectivity MRI networks arise from subject motion",
                        NeuroImage(2011).  Note: data is only excluded during
                        the final correlation, and so will never affect any
                        operations that require the full signal, like
                        regression, etc.
  --fdnumneighbors=NUMNEIGHBORS
                        If --fdthreshold is specified, then
                        --fdnumnumneighbors specifies how many neighboring
                        volumes, before and after the initially excluded
                        volumes, should also be excluded.  Default is 0.
  --motionthreshold=THRESH
                        If specified, any volume whose motion parameters
                        indicate a movement greater than this threshold (in
                        mm) will be excluded ("scrubbed") from the (final)
                        correlation step.  Volume-to-volume movement is
                        calculated per pair of neighboring volumes from the
                        three rotational and three translational parameters
                        generated by mcflirt.  Motion for a pair of
                        neighboring volumes is calculated as the maximum
                        displacement (due to the combined rotation and
                        translation) of any voxel on the 50mm-radius sphere
                        surrounding the center of rotation.  Note: data is
                        only excluded during the final correlation, and so
                        will never affect any operations that require the full
                        signal, like regression, etc.
  --motionnumneighbors=NUMNEIGHBORS
                        If --motionthreshold is specified, then
                        --motionnumnumneighbors specifies how many neighboring
                        volumes, before and after the initially excluded
                        volumes, should also be excluded.  Default is 1.
  --motionpar=FILE.par  If --motionthreshold is specified, then --motionpar
                        specifies the .par file from which the motion
                        parameters are extracted.  If you allow this script to
                        perform motion correction, then this option is
                        ignored.
  --scrubop=SCRUBOP     If --motionthreshold, --dvarsthreshold, or
                        --fdthreshold are specified, then --scrubop specifies
                        the aggregation operator used to determine the final
                        list of excluded volumes.  Default is 'or', which
                        means a volume will be excluded if *any* of its
                        thresholds are exceeded, whereas 'and' means all the
                        thresholds must be exceeded to be excluded.
  --powerscrub          Equivalent to specifying --fdthreshold=0.5
                        --fdnumneighbors=0 --dvarsthreshold=0.5%
                        --dvarsnumneigbhors=0 --scrubop='and', to mimic the
                        method used in the Power et al. article.  Any
                        conflicting options specified before or after this
                        will override these.
  --scrubkeepminvols=NUMVOLS
                        If --motionthreshold, --dvarsthreshold, or
                        --fdthreshold are specified, then --scrubminvols
                        specifies the minimum number of volumes that should
                        pass the threshold before doing any correlation.  If
                        the minimum is not met, then the script exits with an
                        error.  Default is to have no minimum.
  --fcdmthresh=THRESH   R-value threshold to be used in functional
                        connectivity density mapping ( step8 ). Default is set
                        to 0.6. Algorithm from Tomasi et al, PNAS(2010), vol.
                        107, no. 21. Calculates the fcdm of functional data
                        from last completed step, inside a dilated gray matter
                        mask
  --ants                Use ANTs for normalization?
  --cleanup             Delete files from intermediate steps?
